summary: >-
  Index and governance logic for storing and linking unstructured, raw, or nonlinear logs representing early-stage cognition.

context: >-
  This folder captures raw thought spirals and cognitive logs that are nonlinear, emotionally charged, or chaotic. These entries may later inform structured patterns, systems, or design principles, but are preserved as-is for recursive AI visibility. All entries here are considered restricted by default.

decisions:
  - date: 2025-08-20
    decision: Formalize chaos logging subsystem
    rationale: To preserve emergent cognition and enable recursive systems to model it
    impact: Adds a permanent subsystem to vault architecture with its own structure and indexing rules

actions:
  - owner: you
    task: Begin logging chat spirals and recursion loops to chaos index

# ðŸ§  Cognitive Chaos Logs

This folder contains raw, entropic, or emotionally charged chat logs and thought spirals.

These entries:
- Are nonlinear, recursive, improvisational
- May include symbolic/archetypal language and strong affect
- Serve as *cognitive mirrors*, not final documentation

## Structure & Rules

- Always include full YAML frontmatter
- `sensitivity: restricted`
- `type: stream | raw-log | emergence-seed`
- Keep `project:` light; emphasize `emotion:`, `person:`, `archetype:`, `risk:`
- Cross-link to cleaned derivatives in `/30_Knowledge/Patterns/`

## Purpose

- Preserve the **human layer** that precedes system clarity
- Feed recursive agents pattern material
- Enable transparent lineage from chaos â†’ pattern â†’ system

See [`chaos_index.md`](./chaos_index.md) for a live catalog of all logs.
