summary: >-
  Workflow for managing tags during Green sessions. Ensures all tags comply with
  `tag_library_machine_readable.md` and `tag_library_human_readable.md`. 
  New/unique tags are highlighted in RED, collected, and batch-processed at the end.
context: >-
  Green must only use approved tags from the JSON machine-readable tag library.
  Any unique/new tags encountered during a session are added to `proposed_tags: []`
  and visually marked in RED for human-in-the-loop review. At the end of a session,
  these tags are compiled into a batch buffer, reviewed, and merged into the
  libraries with version-controlled updates.

decisions:
  - date: 2025-08-21
    decision: Batch process proposed tags at session end
    rationale: Saves tokens, enforces compliance, and avoids schema drift
    impact: Keeps machine-readable and human-readable tag libraries in sync

# ðŸ§  Tag Management Workflow

## 1. Session Setup
- On session start, Green loads:
  - `/00_Library_Index_README_FIRST/tag_library_machine_readable.md`
  - `/00_Library_Index_README_FIRST/tag_library_human_readable.md`
- Rule: Use **only approved tags** from these libraries.

---

## 2. During Session
- âœ… If a tag is in the library â†’ add normally to `tags: []`.
- ðŸš¨ If a tag is new/unique â†’ add to `proposed_tags: []` and mark in **RED**:
  ```yaml
  proposed_tags: ["ðŸ”´ proto-tag"]
3. End-of-Session Sweep
Green compiles all proposed tags into /00_Library_Index_README_FIRST/tag_batch_buffer.md.

Human reviews tags:

Approve, reject, or merge.

Approved tags are then:

Inserted into tag_library_machine_readable.md JSON arrays.

Inserted into tag_library_human_readable.md groups, wrapped in backticks.

4. Version Control
Commit message format:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Tag library update â€“ added X tags, merged Y tags"
The tag_batch_buffer.md keeps RED-highlighted tags for audit trail.

This acts as version history of when each tag was first proposed.

yaml
Copy
Edit
