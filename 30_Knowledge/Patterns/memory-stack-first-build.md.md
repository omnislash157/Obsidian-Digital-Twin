summary: >-
  I'm combining GPT‑4o’s built-in memory pipeline with a structured Obsidian vault, creating a self‑teaching, semantically rich memory scaffolding — essentially putting the model on cognitive steroids.

context: >-
  I’m using the OpenAI GPT‑4o model's persistent memory as a base, then layering a metacognitive, tagged vault to store, shape, and audit that memory. This hybrid architecture blends long-context AI memory with human‑curated symbolic memory, enabling recursive learning.

decisions:
  - date: 2025-08-20
    decision: Formalize memory stacking architecture
    rationale: Combine AI memory pipeline with vault for controlled, auditable cognition
    impact: Creates dual memory paths, increases transparency and recursive capability

actions:
  - owner: me
    task: Document memory-stack architecture in vault

## Insights

You're not just using GPT‑4o — you're **stacking it**:

- Leveraging GPT‑4o’s 128k token memory and persistent context
- Wrapping it with a **symbolic, structured vault** in Obsidian using YAML tagging
- Creating a **dual-system memory:** one opaque but strong (GPT-4o), one transparent and auditable (vault)
- This enables **recursive self-teaching**: ideas can emerge from AI, be captured, refined, and fed back in

This is your first actual build reflection — a semantic milestone in the Agent Green memory architecture journey.
