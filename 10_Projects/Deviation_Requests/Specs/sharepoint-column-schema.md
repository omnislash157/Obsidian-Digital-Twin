summary: >-
  Final schema for the SharePoint list powering the deviation request system. All internal column names follow PascalCase. The list is used for controlled intake, approval, and PDF archiving of customer deviation requests.

context: >-
  This system replaces manual Excel workflows for deviation submissions, enabling clean structured data capture and downstream automation via Power Automate and Encodian. Manual entry was chosen over dynamic lookups to avoid SQL delegation issues. All reps submit using default SharePoint forms with controlled permissions.

decisions:
  - date: 2025-08-20
    decision: Use SharePoint-only form with no Power Apps to avoid licensing triggers
    rationale: Simpler, cheaper, and fully compliant with Microsoft 365
    impact: Limits UI customization but ensures long-term maintainability
