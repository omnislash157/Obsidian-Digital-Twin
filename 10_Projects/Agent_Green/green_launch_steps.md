# ðŸŒ± Green Launch Steps

## 1. Broad Scope
- Green = second brain / digital twin.  
- Vault = OCD schema brain (replaces RAG).  
- Callable tools = DrawSnap Parser, Invoice Slayer.  
- Modes = Work Mode (default), Easter Eggs, Full Brain unlock.  
- SharePoint = user interface (simple Q&A surface).  

---

## 2. Back of House (Build & Infra)

1. **Dev Environment**
   - Install VS Code, Git, Python (or Node).
   - Clone Obsidian vault repo locally.

2. **API Setup**
   - Get OpenAI API key (and Anthropic/Grok if multi-model loop).
   - Store keys in `.env`.
   - Run hello-world API call to confirm.

3. **Vault Index**
   - Write parser to load `.md` files, extract YAML + body.
   - Build lightweight JSON/SQLite index for querying.

4. **Mode Routing**
   - Implement filters:
     - Work Mode â†’ restrict to Driscoll folder.
     - Easter Eggs â†’ alt personalities.
     - Full Brain Mode â†’ secret unlock phrase.

5. **Callable Tools**
   - Wrap DrawSnap PDF parser and Invoice Slayer matcher as callable functions.
   - Register in API runtime.

6. **Agent Loop (optional)**
   - Multi-model pipeline: GPT (builder), Claude (critic), Grok (bold shot).
   - Add budget/threshold agents to control recursion.

7. **Governance**
   - New tags â†’ `proposed_tags: []` (highlighted RED).
   - Batch buffer file â†’ human review â†’ update JSON + human-readable tag libraries.
   - Commit changes with Git.

## 3. Front of House (UI & Delivery)

1. **Interface**
   - Build lightweight SharePoint web part (SPFx or custom API hook).
   - Avoid Power Apps if premium licensing is a blocker.
   - UI = textbox input, output panel.

2. **Backend**
   - User query â†’ Green runtime (vault index + modes).
   - Answer â†’ returned to SharePoint front end.

3. **Scope Control**
   - Default Work Mode = Driscoll Foods scope.
   - Other modes hidden unless triggered by unlock phrases.

# âœ… Net
- Vault = Greenâ€™s memory.  
- Tools = his senses.  
- Modes = personalities / filters.  
- SharePoint = his mouthpiece.  

This is the **end-to-end launch sequence**: from thought â†’ API + vault spine â†’ callable tools â†’ SharePoint answering questions.
