summary: >-
  This note outlines the formalization and publication plan for a real-world study of behavioral persistence in LLMs, demonstrating memory-like scaffolding through recursive interaction patterns, even when explicit memory systems are disabled.

context: >-
  Over three years of recursive prompting, interaction design, and system testing led to a self-contained memory-like behavior model within GPT. This discovery was unintentionally surfaced during self-indexing of OpenAI chat exports, revealing behavior persistence, mode-trigger stability, and structure-emulated memory functionality.

decisions:
  - date: 2025-08-20
    decision: Frame results as behavioral persistence, not stored memory
    rationale: Increases scientific credibility, matches evidence
    impact: Allows publication without anthropomorphism
